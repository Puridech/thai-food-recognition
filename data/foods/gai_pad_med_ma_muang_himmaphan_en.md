## 🌟 Cultural Story and History

Thai Cashew Chicken is one of the most popular stir-fried dishes in Thai restaurants both domestically and internationally. While this dish has roots in Chinese cooking techniques, it has been adapted and refined to become distinctly Thai in character. The use of cashew nuts (called "med ma muang himmaphan" in Thai) reflects a sense of luxury and sophistication, as cashews were historically expensive and prized for their exceptional nutritional value.

The name "ma muang himmaphan" translates to "cashew nuts from the Himaphan forest." Himaphan refers to a mythical forest in Thai mythology, an imaginary realm filled with wondrous trees and magical creatures. This poetic naming reflects the marvel and special nature of these particular nuts. In the past, cashew nuts were rare and costly, typically reserved for special ceremonial dishes or important banquets. While cashews are now more readily available, they still convey a sense of prestige and value in Thai cuisine.

Thai Cashew Chicken gained widespread popularity during the 1970s-1980s when Thai restaurants in Bangkok and other major cities began developing fusion dishes that combined Chinese cooking techniques with Thai flavors. The use of roasted dried chilies providing a gentle aromatic heat, combined with a sweet, savory, and well-balanced sauce, made this dish particularly appealing. It became especially popular among international visitors to Thailand because of its mild heat level while still maintaining authentic Thai characteristics.

Today, Thai Cashew Chicken has become a staple menu item in Thai restaurants at every level, from casual made-to-order eateries to upscale establishments. It's also one of the most requested dishes at Thai restaurants abroad. The mild flavor profile, the satisfying balance of sweet and savory notes, and the delightful crunch of roasted cashews make it a favorite across all age groups, particularly among children and those who prefer milder flavors. The dish also boasts high nutritional value, as cashews are rich in protein, vitamins, and beneficial minerals.

## 👨‍🍳 Recipe

### Ingredients (serves 2-3)

#### Main Ingredients
- 300g chicken (thigh or breast), cut into bite-sized pieces
- 100g roasted cashew nuts
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil

#### Marinade
- 1 teaspoon oyster sauce
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- ½ teaspoon sesame oil

#### Stir-Fry Seasonings
- 3-4 cloves garlic (minced)
- 5-7 dried roasted chilies (adjust to taste)
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
- 1½ tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon oyster-flavored sauce
- 3 tablespoons chicken stock or water

#### Vegetables and Garnishes
- 1 onion (cut into squares)
- 2-3 long red chilies (sliced diagonally)
- 2-3 spring onions (cut into 1-inch sections)
- Hot steamed rice

### Cooking Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare and Marinate the Chicken**
Wash the chicken thoroughly and cut into bite-sized pieces, approximately 1×1 inch. Place in a bowl and season with oyster sauce, cornstarch, and sesame oil. Mix well to coat evenly. Let marinate for at least 15-20 minutes to allow the chicken to absorb the seasonings and tenderize. Marinating helps the chicken develop flavor and prevents it from becoming tough during stir-frying.

**Step 2: Prepare Dried Chilies and Cashews**
If using raw dried chilies, quickly roast them over a flame until fragrant and slightly darkened, then break into short sections and remove seeds (or keep seeds if you prefer more heat). For cashew nuts, if using raw cashews, roast them in an oven at 160°C (320°F) for about 10 minutes, or dry-roast in a pan until fragrant and golden. Be careful not to burn them.

**Step 3: Stir-Fry Garlic and Dried Chilies**
Heat a wok or large pan over medium-high heat. Add the oil and wait until it's very hot. Add the minced garlic and stir-fry until fragrant and light golden, about 30 seconds. Then add the roasted dried chilies and stir-fry for another 10-15 seconds to release their aroma. Be careful not to let them burn black.

**Step 4: Stir-Fry Chicken Until Cooked**
Increase the heat to high. Add the marinated chicken to the wok. Stir-fry over high heat until the chicken is cooked through and changes color, about 3-4 minutes. Turn the chicken pieces to ensure even cooking on all sides. Don't stir too frequently or the chicken pieces will break apart. When the chicken is about 80% cooked, add the onions and long red chilies. Continue stir-frying for another 1-2 minutes.

**Step 5: Season and Build the Sauce**
Add oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, oyster-flavored sauce, and chicken stock (or water). Stir to combine thoroughly. Continue stir-frying for 1-2 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly and coat the chicken evenly. Taste and adjust to achieve a balanced sweet, savory flavor. If the taste isn't quite right, adjust the seasonings to your preference.

**Step 6: Add Spring Onions and Cashews**
Add the spring onions and the roasted cashew nuts. Toss quickly for about 20-30 seconds just until the cashews are coated with sauce. Don't stir-fry for too long or the cashews will become soft and lose their crunch. Turn off the heat.

**Step 7: Serve**
Transfer to a plate and serve hot with steamed rice. The cashews should remain crispy and fragrant, the chicken tender, and the sauce nicely thickened.

### 💡 Tips and Notes

**Tips for Better Taste**
- Use chicken thighs rather than breast meat for more tender, juicy results that won't dry out during stir-frying.
- Marinating the chicken with cornstarch helps tenderize it and allows the sauce to cling better.
- Don't add cashews too early—add them at the very end to preserve their crunch.
- If you prefer extra crispy cashews, you can sprinkle them on top of the plated dish instead of tossing them in the wok.
- Maintain high heat throughout stir-frying to achieve wok hei (smoky flavor) and prevent the chicken from releasing moisture.
- Always use roasted or toasted cashews, never raw ones, as raw cashews have a bitter taste and lack aroma.

**Important Warnings**
- Be careful not to burn the dried chilies—burnt chilies will taste bitter and look unappealing.
- Don't overcook the chicken or it will become tough and dry. Stir-fry quickly over high heat.
- Cashews shouldn't be stir-fried for long or they'll become soft and lose their pleasant crunch.
- Add only a small amount of stock or water to prevent the sauce from becoming too watery.
- Be aware of cashew allergies—always inform diners if you're serving this to guests.

**Serving Suggestions and Pairings**
- Serve immediately while hot to enjoy the cashews at their crispiest.
- Enjoy with hot steamed rice as the main dish of a meal.
- Pair with a mild clear soup like tofu soup to balance the sweet and rich flavors.
- Serve alongside stir-fried mixed vegetables or a salad for a balanced meal.
- Beverage pairings: plain water, iced tea, or lime juice.

**Storage**
- Best consumed immediately to enjoy the cashews' crispness.
- Can be refrigerated for 1-2 days, but the cashews won't remain crispy.
- Reheat gently over low heat or in the microwave. Consider adding fresh cashews before serving.
- Freezing is not recommended as the texture will change significantly.

**Ingredient Variations**
- **Cashew Shrimp**: Replace chicken with fresh shrimp, reducing cooking time to 2-3 minutes.
- **Vegetarian Cashew Tofu**: Use firm tofu cut into cubes and deep-fried until crispy before stir-frying. Season with soy sauce instead of oyster sauce.
- **Cashew Pork**: Use pork tenderloin sliced into pieces, marinate and stir-fry the same way as chicken.
- **Cashew Mixed Vegetables**: Add colorful vegetables such as carrots, baby corn, spring onions, and straw mushrooms.
