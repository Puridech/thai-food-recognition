## 🌟 Cultural Story and History

Gung Ob Woon Sen is a Thai dish rooted in Chinese culinary traditions, particularly the baking and steaming methods popular among Teochew and Hokkien Chinese communities. Historically, cooking in clay pots was a technique that helped retain the moisture of proteins while allowing the aromatic seasonings to penetrate deeply into the food. The use of glass noodles (also called mung bean vermicelli or cellophane noodles), made from mung bean starch, serves as the perfect vehicle to absorb all the flavorful sauce and aromatic ingredients, resulting in silky, slippery noodles packed with taste.

This dish gained widespread popularity in Bangkok and Central Thailand during the 1960s-1970s, particularly among the middle and upper classes who sought elegant and refined cuisine. Gung Ob Woon Sen became a favorite for important banquets, celebrations, and formal receptions because of its beautiful presentation and relatively expensive ingredients. Large river prawns, in particular, symbolized prosperity and luxurious hospitality, making this dish a statement of generosity and good taste.

What makes Gung Ob Woon Sen special is the use of a clay pot for baking, which distributes heat evenly and allows the food to cook slowly without drying out. The gentle heat from the clay pot keeps the prawns tender, sweet, and juicy, while the glass noodles absorb the wonderful aromatics from ginger, garlic, soy sauce, and sesame oil, creating a deeply flavorful and well-rounded dish. Serving the dish in a hot clay pot also maintains the food's temperature longer and adds an impressive traditional touch to the dining experience.

Today, Gung Ob Woon Sen is a signature dish in seafood restaurants and Chinese-Thai establishments. It's often an essential part of special meals or family gatherings because, beyond being delicious, it carries symbolic meaning as a gesture of offering the best to guests. In Chinese, glass noodles sound similar to the word for "good fortune," making this an auspicious dish perfect for celebrations and festivals, especially Chinese New Year and birthdays. The dish has also gained international recognition in Thai restaurants worldwide due to its approachable flavors, accessible taste profile, and visually striking presentation.

## 👨‍🍳 Recipe

### Ingredients (serves 2-3)

#### Main Ingredients
- 6-8 large river prawns (about 400-500g)
- 100g glass noodles (mung bean vermicelli)
- 100g thinly sliced pork belly (optional)

#### Baking Sauce
- 2 tablespoons light soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon seasoning sauce
- ½ teaspoon ground white pepper
- ½ cup chicken stock or water

#### Aromatics
- 5-6 cloves garlic (finely minced)
- 3 slices fresh ginger (julienned)
- 3-4 cilantro roots (roughly chopped)
- 3-4 spring onions (cut into 1-inch sections)
- 2-3 stalks Chinese celery (cut into sections - optional)

#### Garnishes
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- Fresh cilantro for garnish
- Whole peppercorns for garnish
- Chili sauce (seafood dipping sauce) as accompaniment

### Cooking Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare Glass Noodles and Prawns**
Soak the glass noodles in warm water for 10-15 minutes until softened. Drain and use scissors to cut them into shorter lengths, about 4-5 inches, for easier eating. For the prawns, wash thoroughly, use scissors to trim off the whiskers and legs, and make a cut along the back to remove the dark vein while keeping the prawn intact. Rinse again and pat dry. If using pork belly, slice thinly into bite-sized pieces.

**Step 2: Make the Baking Sauce**
In a medium bowl, combine light soy sauce, oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, seasoning sauce, ground white pepper, and chicken stock (or water). Stir until the sugar dissolves and all ingredients are well mixed. Taste to ensure a balanced sweet, salty, and savory flavor. This sauce will determine the overall taste of the dish.

**Step 3: Stir-Fry Garlic and Layer Noodles**
Heat a wok or pan over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Once hot, add half of the minced garlic and stir-fry until fragrant and light golden. Be careful not to burn it. Transfer the fried garlic to a clay pot (or oven-safe pot), spreading it evenly across the bottom. Place the soaked and cut glass noodles on top of the garlic, spreading them out. Pour about half of the prepared sauce over the noodles and toss gently to coat evenly.

**Step 4: Arrange Prawns and Pork**
Arrange the prepared prawns on top of the glass noodles in an attractive pattern. If using pork belly, alternate the pork slices with the prawns. Pour the remaining sauce over everything, ensuring the prawns and noodles are well coated. Sprinkle the julienned ginger, cilantro roots, and remaining minced garlic over the prawns. Add the spring onions and Chinese celery (if using). Drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over everything.

**Step 5: Bake in Oven or Cook on Stovetop**
**Method 1 - Oven Baking**: Cover the clay pot tightly with its lid. Place in a preheated oven at 180-200°C (350-400°F) and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the prawns are cooked through and turn pink, and the glass noodles are soft and have absorbed the sauce.

**Method 2 - Stovetop Cooking**: Place the clay pot on a gas stove over very low heat. Cover with the lid and cook for 12-15 minutes. Check occasionally to ensure the prawns are cooked and the noodles aren't sticking to the bottom. If the liquid reduces too much, add a little chicken stock or water.

**Step 6: Check for Doneness**
When the cooking time is complete, open the lid. The prawns should be bright orange with opaque, firm white flesh. The glass noodles should be tender, translucent, and have absorbed the sauce, taking on a light brown color. If the prawns aren't fully cooked, cover and cook for another 3-5 minutes.

**Step 7: Garnish and Serve**
Garnish with fresh cilantro and ground white pepper or lightly crushed whole peppercorns. Serve hot directly from the clay pot along with chili sauce (seafood dipping sauce) and hot steamed rice. Serving in the clay pot maintains heat and adds an authentic traditional atmosphere.

### 💡 Tips and Notes

**Tips for Better Taste**
- Choose large, fresh river prawns for maximum sweetness and tenderness compared to frozen shrimp.
- Soak the glass noodles until just softened—don't over-soak or they'll become mushy, as they'll continue cooking during baking.
- Cutting the glass noodles shorter makes them easier to eat and helps them absorb the sauce better.
- For a richer flavor, add a bit more oyster sauce or soy sauce.
- Adding pork belly contributes richness and aromatic depth to the sauce.
- If you don't have a clay pot, use any oven-safe pot or baking dish with a lid.
- Use a clay pot with a tight-fitting lid to trap steam and heat effectively.

**Important Warnings**
- Don't overbake—prawns will become tough and rubbery. Check periodically.
- When cooking on the stovetop, use very low heat to prevent the noodles from sticking and burning at the bottom.
- Be careful not to let all the sauce evaporate—leave some liquid for moisture and flavor.
- Clay pots get extremely hot. Use oven mitts or thick towels when handling.
- If using a new clay pot, soak it in water before first use to prevent cracking.

**Serving Suggestions and Pairings**
- Serve hot directly from the clay pot while still steaming.
- Enjoy with hot steamed rice, spooning the noodles, prawns, and sauce over the rice.
- Serve with chili sauce (seafood dipping sauce) on the side for the prawns.
- Pair with stir-fried vegetables or a mild clear soup for balance.
- Perfect for special occasions, gatherings, or celebrations.
- Beverage pairings: plain water, Chinese tea, or cold beer.

**Storage**
- Best consumed immediately for optimal freshness and tender prawns.
- Can be refrigerated for 1-2 days, but prawns will become firmer and less tender.
- Reheat gently over low heat or in the microwave, adding a splash of water to prevent drying.
- Freezing is not recommended as the texture of both prawns and noodles will deteriorate.

**Ingredient Variations**
- **Baked Crab with Glass Noodles**: Replace prawns with sea crab or blue crab, slightly increasing baking time.
- **Baked Squid with Glass Noodles**: Use sliced squid rings, reducing cooking time to prevent toughness.
- **Mixed Seafood with Glass Noodles**: Combine prawns, crab, squid, and shellfish.
- **Baked Oysters with Glass Noodles**: Use fresh oysters instead of prawns for natural sweetness.
- **Vegetarian Version**: Use multiple mushroom varieties such as oyster mushrooms, shiitake, and golden needle mushrooms. Season with soy sauce instead of oyster sauce.
