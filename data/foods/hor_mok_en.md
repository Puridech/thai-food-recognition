## 🌟 Cultural Story and History

Hor Mok is an ancient Thai dish with a long and distinguished history, believed to have originated during the Ayutthaya period or even earlier. The name "hor mok" comes from the cooking method: wrapping the ingredients in banana leaves and then steaming or "mok" (burying/covering to cook) until done. Using banana leaves not only helps the food cook evenly and imparts a wonderful aromatic quality, but also represents traditional wisdom in food preservation and beautiful presentation. Historically, Hor Mok was a dish reserved for the upper classes and royal court, as it required high-quality ingredients and considerable skill to prepare.

Hor Mok exemplifies the refinement and attention to detail characteristic of Thai cuisine. The harmonious combination of fragrant, spicy curry paste, rich coconut cream, tender fish or shrimp, and eggs that create a soft custard-like texture results in a dish with complex, profound flavors. The use of banana leaves not only adds natural fragrance and beauty but also embodies the Thai culinary philosophy of incorporating nature into cooking. Thus, Hor Mok is not merely delicious—it's visually stunning and culturally meaningful.

Although Hor Mok originated in Central Thailand, it has gained widespread popularity throughout the country, particularly in the South where it has evolved into versions with more intense, spicier flavors. The South's abundance of fresh seafood and preference for bold tastes has led to distinct regional variations. Different regions use different proteins—some prefer sea bass, others use snakehead fish, shrimp, or even mussels. This diversity reflects Thai people's creativity and adaptation to local ingredients and preferences in each area.

Today, Hor Mok is a popular menu item in Thai restaurants both domestically and internationally, often served as an appetizer or main course, especially in seafood restaurants. Modern Hor Mok comes in various forms, from traditional versions steamed in banana leaf cups (kratong) to Southern-style small individual wraps, or even Hor Mok made in ramekins instead of banana leaves. Regardless of the presentation method, Hor Mok maintains its distinctive characteristics: the aromatic curry fragrance, the creaminess from coconut milk, and the soft, delicate texture that defines this elegant dish.

## 👨‍🍳 Recipe

### Ingredients (serves 2-3 / makes approximately 6-8 cups)

#### Main Ingredients
- 300g fish fillet (sea bass or snakehead fish), roughly chopped or thinly sliced
- 100g fresh shrimp, peeled and roughly chopped (optional)
- 2 chicken eggs
- 1½ cups coconut milk (divided into ½ cup coconut cream and 1 cup coconut milk)
- Banana leaves for wrapping (cut into circles 8-10 inches in diameter)

#### Red Curry Paste
- 5-7 dried chilies, seeded and roasted
- 3-4 cloves garlic
- 2-3 shallots
- 2 slices galangal
- 1 stalk lemongrass (finely chopped)
- 2-3 cilantro plants (roots and stems)
- 1 teaspoon shrimp paste
- ½ teaspoon salt

#### Seasonings
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 1 teaspoon palm sugar
- 2 tablespoons rice flour (for thickening)

#### Vegetables and Garnishes
- 4-5 kaffir lime leaves (finely julienned)
- 1-2 red spur chilies (sliced diagonally)
- 1 handful Thai basil leaves
- ¼ cup coconut cream for topping
- Shredded napa cabbage or cabbage (for lining the bottom of cups - optional)

### Cooking Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare the Curry Paste**
Place the roasted dried chilies, garlic, shallots, galangal, lemongrass, cilantro roots, shrimp paste, and salt in a mortar or food processor. Pound or blend until you get a fine, smooth curry paste (if using a food processor, you may add a little water to help with blending). The resulting paste should be aromatic and smooth in texture. This curry paste is the heart of Hor Mok and will determine the entire dish's flavor profile.

**Step 2: Mix the Hor Mok Ingredients**
In a large bowl, combine the prepared curry paste, coconut milk, fish sauce, palm sugar, and rice flour. Mix well until combined. Then add the fish, shrimp (if using), and eggs. Stir everything together until you get a smooth, moderately thick mixture. Add half of the Thai basil leaves and julienned kaffir lime leaves. Stir once more. Taste to ensure a balanced flavor of salty, sweet, and mildly spicy.

**Step 3: Prepare Banana Leaf Cups**
Wash the banana leaves clean and dry them. Pass them briefly over a flame to soften them and prevent tearing. Fold the banana leaves into cup shapes (kratong) by folding into square or round forms. Use toothpicks or wire to secure them firmly. Alternatively, for a simpler method, you can use aluminum or ceramic cups lined with banana leaves. If you want to prevent sticking, line the bottom with shredded napa cabbage or cabbage.

**Step 4: Fill the Cups**
Ladle the prepared Hor Mok mixture into the banana leaf cups, filling to about ¾ full. Don't fill completely or it will overflow during steaming. Drizzle a small amount of coconut cream on top. Garnish with julienned kaffir lime leaves and sliced red chilies for decoration. Repeat until all mixture is used.

**Step 5: Steam the Hor Mok**
Bring water to a boil in a steamer. Place the Hor Mok cups in the steamer and cover with a lid. Steam over medium heat for 15-20 minutes (depending on cup size). Hor Mok is done when no liquid mixture sticks to your finger when touched, and the top has set into a soft custard. Be careful not to let the water boil too vigorously or the Hor Mok will have holes and won't be smooth.

**Step 6: Serve**
Once the Hor Mok is fully cooked, remove from the steamer. Let cool slightly. Serve hot or warm in the banana leaf cups. Good Hor Mok should have a soft, smooth custard-like texture, be fragrant with curry spices and banana leaves, have a well-rounded flavor from the coconut milk, and possess a mild, pleasant heat.

### 💡 Tips and Notes

**Tips for Perfect Hor Mok**
- Use fresh fish without bones for a tender, delicious Hor Mok.
- The curry paste must be pounded or blended very finely to achieve smooth Hor Mok without hard bits.
- Using thick coconut cream will make the Hor Mok aromatic and richly flavored.
- Adding rice flour helps thicken the Hor Mok and prevents it from being too watery.
- Don't fill the cups completely—fill only ¾ full to prevent overflow during steaming.
- Steam over medium heat—don't use too high heat or the Hor Mok will have holes.
- Pass banana leaves briefly over flame before using to soften them and prevent tearing.

**Important Warnings**
- Be careful that boiling water in the steamer doesn't rise too high and splash into the Hor Mok cups.
- Banana leaves must be secured firmly to prevent the mixture from leaking out.
- Don't steam for too long or the Hor Mok will become hard and dry. Check by touching to see if the mixture has set.
- The coconut cream drizzled on top shouldn't be excessive or the Hor Mok will be too oily.
- If using cups instead of banana leaves, lightly oil them first to prevent sticking.

- Enjoy with hot steamed rice as a delicious, satisfying main dish.
