## 🌟 Cultural Story and History

Khanom Krok is an ancient Thai dessert with a history spanning hundreds of years, believed to have originated during the Ayutthaya period. The name "Khanom Krok" comes from the cooking tool used to make it—the "krok pan" or "krok griddle," which is an iron or clay pan with multiple small, round indentations resembling mortars (krok) used for pounding. Using this special griddle is a demonstration of Thai ingenuity in creating a dessert with a distinctive round shape, crispy bottom, and soft top—a unique characteristic that cannot be found in any other dessert.

Khanom Krok reflects the simplicity and cleverness of Thai people in utilizing local ingredients. The main components are rice flour, coconut milk, and palm sugar—all easily accessible ingredients throughout Thailand. Coconuts, in particular, are an important economic crop and are abundantly available. The use of coconut milk and shredded coconut in Khanom Krok not only provides a sweet, fragrant taste but also reflects the cultural practice of maximizing coconut utilization. Thus, Khanom Krok is more than just a dessert—it's part of the simple, warm Thai way of life.

Historically, Khanom Krok was sold at markets, temple fairs, and festivals. Vendors typically made fresh Khanom Krok right in front of customers, with the entire process visible—from pouring batter into the molds, adding filling, covering until cooked, and serving hot. The aromatic scent of coconut milk and coconut often attracted people to stop and taste. Khanom Krok was commonly enjoyed as an afternoon snack or breakfast that Thai people loved to buy and eat. Its sweet but not cloying taste and special texture made it beloved by all ages, especially children who enjoyed the crispy-outside-soft-inside contrast.

Today, Khanom Krok remains a popular Thai dessert found everywhere, from fresh markets and street markets to Thai dessert shops. Beyond the traditional coconut filling, there are now many creative variations such as corn, spring onion, pandan, green tea, and even chocolate fillings. These innovations keep Khanom Krok modern and appealing to younger generations. Additionally, Khanom Krok has become one of the Thai desserts popular among international tourists due to its balanced sweetness, interesting texture, and the entertaining street food-style preparation that's fun to watch.

## 👨‍🍳 Recipe

### Ingredients (serves 2-3 / makes approximately 20-24 pieces)

#### Bottom Batter (Crispy Layer)
- 1 cup rice flour
- 1 cup water
- ½ cup palm sugar (or regular sugar)
- ¼ teaspoon salt

#### Top Batter (Soft Layer)
- ½ cup rice flour
- 1 cup thick coconut milk
- 3 tablespoons palm sugar
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons sticky rice flour (for stickiness and smoothness)

#### Filling
- 1 cup shredded coconut (mature coconut, shredded into long strands)
- 2 tablespoons palm sugar
- Pinch of salt (for mixing with shredded coconut)

#### Equipment
- Krok pan (Khanom Krok griddle) or round mold pan
- Vegetable oil for greasing pan
- Lid

### Cooking Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare Bottom Batter**
In a medium bowl, mix rice flour, water, palm sugar, and salt. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Strain the batter through a sieve or thin cloth to remove any lumps. The batter should be moderately thick liquid—not too thin or too thick. Taste to ensure proper sweetness. Set aside.

**Step 2: Prepare Top Batter**
In another bowl, mix rice flour, sticky rice flour, thick coconut milk, palm sugar, and salt. Stir until smooth. Strain through a sieve as well. This batter should be slightly thicker than the bottom batter, as it needs to float on top. Taste to ensure sweet, rich coconut flavor. Set aside.

**Step 3: Prepare Coconut Filling**
Mix shredded coconut with palm sugar and a pinch of salt. Mix well to combine. Taste to ensure a balanced sweet-salty flavor. Adding a little salt enhances the coconut's natural sweetness. Set aside.

**Step 4: Heat Krok Pan and Prepare to Cook**
Place the krok pan on a gas stove or charcoal grill over medium heat. Wait until the pan is thoroughly hot (test by sprinkling water—if it evaporates quickly, it's ready). Lightly brush each indentation with vegetable oil using a pastry brush or tissue paper to prevent sticking. Don't use too much oil or the pancakes will be greasy.

**Step 5: Pour Batter and Add Filling**
Pour the bottom batter into each indentation about ⅔ full (don't fill completely as you need room for the top batter). Wait until the batter starts to cook and the edges begin to dry (about 1-2 minutes). Add about 1 teaspoon of coconut filling in the center of each. Then pour the coconut milk top batter over the filling until the indentation is full. Immediately cover with the lid.

**Step 6: Steam Until Cooked**
Cover tightly and steam over medium heat for 3-5 minutes. Don't open the lid frequently or steam will escape and the Khanom Krok won't cook properly. They're done when the top layer is set and no liquid mixture sticks to your finger when touched. The bottom should be slightly crispy and light brown.

**Step 7: Remove and Serve**
Use a spoon or small spatula to carefully remove the Khanom Krok from the indentations. Place on a plate or basket. Serve hot immediately for maximum crispiness and flavor. Good Khanom Krok should have a slightly crispy bottom, soft body, fragrant coconut aroma, and sweet-salty coconut filling.

### 💡 Tips and Notes

**Tips for Perfect Khanom Krok**
- Strain both batters through a sieve for smooth, lump-free pancakes.
- The krok pan must be thoroughly hot before pouring batter for crispy results that don't stick.
- Use only a small amount of oil to grease the pan. Too much will make them greasy and not crispy.
- Don't open the lid frequently while steaming—steam will escape and they won't cook properly.
- The top batter should be thick enough not to sink into the bottom batter.
- For crispier bottoms, use slightly higher heat during the initial stage.
- Use mature coconut shredded into long strands for better texture than young coconut.

**Important Warnings**
- Be careful of hot steam when opening the lid—it can burst out and cause burns.
- The krok pan gets very hot. Avoid direct contact.
- Too high heat will burn the bottom before the top cooks through.
- Don't fill the bottom batter to the top—leave room for the top layer.
- If the batter is too thin, the Khanom Krok won't be crispy and will be mushy.

**Serving Suggestions and Pairings**
- Eat hot immediately after cooking for maximum crispiness and aroma.
- Perfect as an afternoon snack or breakfast treat.
- Pair with hot tea, coffee, or cold beverages.
- Great for gifts or selling at temple fairs and markets.
- Delicious on its own without accompaniments.

**Storage**
- Khanom Krok is best eaten immediately while hot.
- Can refrigerate for 1-2 days but won't be as crispy.
- Reheat in microwave for 20-30 seconds or lightly pan-fry for crispiness.
- Freezing is not recommended as the texture will change.

**Other Filling Variations**
- **Corn Filling**: Use fresh sweet corn kernels roughly chopped, mixed with sugar and a little salt
- **Spring Onion Filling**: Use finely chopped spring onions mixed with white pepper and salt (savory version)
- **Pandan Filling**: Mix pandan extract into the top batter, use regular coconut filling
- **Green Tea Filling**: Mix green tea powder into the top batter for subtle tea fragrance
- **Black Bean Filling**: Use boiled, mashed black beans mixed with sugar
- **Chocolate Filling**: Use chocolate chips or chopped chocolate (for modern twist)
- **Shrimp Filling**: Use minced shrimp mixed with white pepper, cilantro root, and salt (savory version)

**Making Without a Krok Pan**
- Use a donut pan or muffin pan instead of a krok pan
- Use a regular pan on very low heat and spoon batter into small circles
- Bake in an oven at 180°C (350°F) in muffin cups
