## 🌟 Cultural Story and History

Tom Yum Goong is arguably Thailand's most internationally recognized dish, serving as the quintessential ambassador of Thai cuisine worldwide. This iconic soup originated in Central Thailand, particularly in the fertile Chao Phraya River basin where freshwater prawns thrive. The name "Tom Yum" describes the cooking method: "Tom" means to boil, while "Yum" refers to the Thai-style spicy and sour salad, together creating a soup that's vibrantly seasoned and intensely flavorful. The signature sour-spicy taste comes from a harmonious blend of lime juice, chilies, and aromatic Thai herbs that create an unforgettable flavor experience.

Historically, Tom Yum Goong was a humble dish enjoyed by riverside communities who had easy access to fresh prawns and fish. The liberal use of local herbs like lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, and galangal wasn't just about adding fragrance and flavor - these ingredients also served medicinal purposes, aiding digestion and helping to expel wind from the stomach. Tom Yum was thus both delicious food and herbal medicine rolled into one. Over time, the recipe was refined and elevated, eventually becoming a signature dish in high-end restaurants and hotels throughout the country, while never losing its soul as comfort food for everyday Thai people.

Tom Yum Goong comes in two main variations: "Tom Yum Nam Sai" (clear soup) which emphasizes the pure, clean flavors of the broth and the aromatic herbs, and "Tom Yum Nam Khon" (creamy soup) which incorporates chili paste and evaporated milk or coconut milk for a richer, creamier texture and more intense flavor. In 2011, CNN Travel ranked Tom Yum Goong as the 8th most delicious food in the world out of 50 dishes. More recently, in 2021, Tom Yum Goong was inscribed as part of Thailand's Intangible Cultural Heritage, recognizing its profound importance to Thai culinary identity and culture.

Tom Yum Goong is suitable for every occasion - lunch, dinner, or as a welcoming dish for guests. The sour and spicy flavors stimulate the appetite wonderfully, especially during hot weather or the rainy season when the warming soup helps keep the body comfortable and can even help prevent colds, thanks to its medicinal herbs and spices. Tom Yum Goong isn't just delicious food - it's a health-promoting dish that both Thai people and international visitors absolutely adore, representing the perfect harmony of flavor, aroma, and wellness that defines Thai cuisine.

## 👨‍🍳 Recipe

### Ingredients (serves 2-3)

#### Main Ingredients
- 300-400g fresh prawns/shrimp (shell and devein, but keep heads and shells for stock)
- 150g straw mushrooms or oyster mushrooms (cleaned and halved)
- 5-6 cherry tomatoes (halved)

#### Tom Yum Aromatics
- 3-4 stalks lemongrass (cut into 2-inch pieces, bruise with knife)
- 30-40g galangal (thinly sliced)
- 5-6 kaffir lime leaves (tear out center vein)
- 5-10 Thai bird's eye chilies (lightly crushed, adjust to heat preference)
- 3-4 shallots (peeled and left whole)

#### Seasonings
- 3-4 cups water or stock
- 2-3 tablespoons fish sauce
- 3-4 tablespoons fresh lime juice
- 2-3 tablespoons Thai chili paste (nam prik pao) - for creamy version
- 1/2 cup evaporated milk or fresh milk - for creamy version
- 1 teaspoon chili powder (optional)

#### Garnishes
- Fresh cilantro for topping
- Spring onions, cut into sections
- Thai basil leaves (if available)

### Cooking Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare ingredients and make prawn stock**
Shell and devein the prawns, reserving the heads and shells. Clean the mushrooms. In a pot, bring 3-4 cups of water to a boil, add the prawn heads and shells, and simmer for about 10 minutes to extract the sweet prawn flavor. This creates a flavorful stock base. Strain out the heads and shells, keeping the aromatic prawn stock.

**Step 2: Infuse aromatics into the stock**
Return the prawn stock to a boil. Add lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, and shallots. Let these simmer for 3-5 minutes to release their aromatic oils into the broth. The soup should now smell incredibly fragrant and inviting.

**Step 3: Add mushrooms and tomatoes**
Add the straw mushrooms and cherry tomatoes to the boiling soup. Cook until the mushrooms are tender and the tomatoes begin to soften, about 2-3 minutes. Be careful not to overcook the tomatoes or they'll become too mushy.

**Step 4: Season and add prawns**
Season the soup with fish sauce and Thai chili paste (if making the creamy version). Taste to ensure proper saltiness. Add the cleaned prawns and cook just until they curl and turn pink-orange, about 2-3 minutes. Be very careful not to overcook the prawns or they'll become tough and rubbery.

**Step 5: Add milk and chilies**
(For creamy Tom Yum) Reduce heat to low and add evaporated milk or fresh milk, stirring gently to incorporate. Don't let it boil vigorously or the milk will separate. Add the lightly crushed Thai chilies for that signature heat.

**Step 6: Turn off heat and add lime juice**
Turn off the heat completely, then squeeze in the fresh lime juice. Taste and adjust the seasoning to achieve a perfect balance of sour, spicy, and salty flavors. Never add lime juice while the soup is still boiling, as the heat will make it taste bitter.

**Step 7: Garnish and serve**
Ladle into bowls, garnish with fresh cilantro, spring onions, and Thai basil leaves. Serve piping hot with steamed jasmine rice.

### 💡 Tips and Notes

**Tips for Perfect Tom Yum Goong:**
- **Use fresh prawns**: Fresh prawns provide the best sweet flavor and tender texture. If using frozen prawns, thaw them completely at room temperature before cooking.
- **Make prawn stock**: Don't skip making stock from the prawn heads and shells - this is what gives Tom Yum its authentic deep seafood flavor and natural sweetness. Store-bought stock simply can't compare.
- **Fresh aromatics are essential**: Lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime leaves must be fresh, not dried. Fresh herbs give that authentic aromatic punch that defines true Tom Yum. Dried versions have significantly less fragrance.
- **Bruise the aromatics**: Lightly bruise or crush the lemongrass and galangal to release their aromatic oils, but don't chop them too finely - they're mainly for flavoring, not eating.
- **Timing for lime juice**: Never add lime juice while the soup is boiling - always turn off the heat first. The residual heat will extract the flavor without making it bitter from overcooking.

**Important Warnings:**
- **Don't overcook the prawns**: Prawns cook very quickly - they're done as soon as they curl and turn pink (2-3 minutes). Overcooking makes them tough and rubbery.
- **Prevent milk separation**: (For creamy Tom Yum) Don't let the milk boil vigorously. Add it on low heat and stir gently to incorporate smoothly.
- **Adjust spice level carefully**: If you're not accustomed to spicy food, reduce the number of chilies or remove the seeds. You can always add more heat, but you can't take it away.
- **Don't overdo the lime**: Too much lime juice will make the soup overly sour and can introduce bitterness. Add gradually and taste as you go.
- **Aromatics are for flavor only**: The lemongrass and galangal pieces are meant to infuse flavor - remind diners not to eat these woody, fibrous pieces.

**Serving Suggestions and Pairings:**
- **With steamed jasmine rice**: This is the classic, essential pairing. The mild rice perfectly balances the intense Tom Yum flavors.
- **As part of a Thai meal**: Tom Yum typically appears alongside stir-fries, curries, salads, and other dishes on a Thai dining table, creating a harmonious variety of flavors.
- **As a standalone soup**: Some people enjoy Tom Yum on its own without rice, especially the creamy version which is more substantial.
- **Beverage pairings**: Ice-cold beer or fresh lime juice helps cool down the spiciness while complementing the flavors beautifully.

**Style Variations:**
- **Tom Yum Nam Sai (Clear Soup)**: No chili paste or milk - the broth is clear and transparent. Emphasizes the pure aromatic herbs with a sharp, clean sour-spicy flavor profile.
- **Tom Yum Nam Khon (Creamy Soup)**: Includes Thai chili paste and evaporated milk or coconut milk. The soup has a reddish-orange color, creamy texture, and more intense, rounded flavor.
- **Tom Yum Talay (Seafood Tom Yum)**: Uses mixed seafood like squid, mussels, crab, and fish instead of just prawns for variety.
- **Tom Yum Gai or Moo (Chicken or Pork)**: Substitutes chicken or pork for prawns - perfect for those with seafood allergies.

**Health Benefits:**
- The herbs in Tom Yum - lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime leaves - have medicinal properties that aid digestion and help expel intestinal gas.
- Lime is rich in vitamin C, supporting immune system function.
- Chilies stimulate blood circulation and boost metabolism.
- Prawns are an excellent source of high-quality protein and omega-3 fatty acids.
